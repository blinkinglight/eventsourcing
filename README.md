# Overview

This package is an experiment to try to generialize [@jen20's](https://github.com/jen20) way of implementing event sourcing. You can find the original blog post [here](http://jen20.com/2015/02/08/event-sourcing-in-go.html) and github repo [here](https://github.com/jen20/go-event-sourcing-sample).

## Event Sourcing

[Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) is a technique to make it possible to capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.

### Aggregate Root

The *aggregate root* is the central point where events are bound. The aggregate struct needs to embed `eventsourcing.AggreateRoot` to get the aggregate behaviors.

Below, a *Person* aggregate where the Aggregate Root is embedded next to the `Name` and `Age` properties.

```go
type Person struct {
	eventsourcing.AggregateRoot
	Name string
	Age  int
}
```

The aggregate needs to implement the `Transition(event eventsourcing.Event)` function to fulfill the aggregate interface. This function define how events are transformed to build the aggregate state.

Example of the Transition function from the `Person` aggregate.

```go
// Transition the person state dependent on the events
func (person *Person) Transition(event eventsourcing.Event) {
        switch e := event.Data.(type) {
        case *Born:
                person.Age = 0
                person.Name = e.Name
        case *AgedOneYear:
                person.Age += 1
        }
}
```

In this example we can see that the `Born` event sets the `Person` property `Age` and `Name`, and that the `AgedOneYear` adds one year to the `Age` property. This makes the state of the aggregate flexible and could easily change in the future if required.

### Aggregate Event

An event is a clean struct with exported properties that contains the state of the event.

Example of two events from the `Person` aggregate.

```go
// Initial event
type Born struct {
        Name string
}

// Event that happens once a year
type AgedOneYear struct {}
```

When an aggregate is first created, an event is needed to initialize the state of the aggregate. No event, no aggregate. Below is an example of a constructor that returns the `Person` aggregate and inside it binds an event via the `TrackChange` function. It's possible to define rules that the aggregate must uphold before an event is created, in this case the person's name must not be blank.

```go
// CreatePerson constructor for Person
func CreatePerson(name string) (*Person, error) {
	if name == "" {
		return nil, errors.New("name can't be blank")
	}
	person := Person{}
	err := person.TrackChange(&person, &Born{Name: name})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &person, nil
}
```

When a person is created, more events could be created via functions on the `Person` aggregate. Below is the `GrowOlder` function which in turn triggers the event `AgedOneYear`. This event is tracked on the person aggregate.

```go
// GrowOlder command
func (person *Person) GrowOlder() error {
	return person.TrackChange(person, &AgedOneYear{})
}
```

Internally the `TrackChange` functions calls the `Transition` function on the aggregate to transform the aggregate based on the newly created event.

The internal `Event` looks like this.

```go
type Event struct {
    // aggregate identifier 
    AggregateRootID AggregateRootID
    // the aggregate version when this event was created
    Version         Version
    // name of the event (Born / AgedOneYear in the example above)
    Reason          string
     // aggregate type (Person in the example above)
    AggregateType   string
     // The specific event data specified in the application (Born{}, AgedOneYear{})
    Data            interface{}
     // extra data that donÂ´t belongs to the application state (could be correlation id or other request references)
    MetaData        map[string]interface{}
}
```

## Repository

The repository is used to save and retrieve aggregates. The main functions are:

```go
// saves the events on the aggregate
Save(aggregate aggregate) error

// retrieves and build an aggregate from events based on its identifier
Get(id string, aggregate aggregate) error
```

It is possible to save a snapshot of an aggregate reducing the amount of event needed to be fetched and applied.

```go
// saves the aggregate (an error will be returned if there are unsaved events on the aggregate when doing this operation)
SaveSnapshot(aggregate aggregate) error
```

The repository constructor input values is an event store and a snapshot store, this handles the reading and writing of events and snapshots. We will dig deeper on the internals below.

```go
NewRepository(eventStore eventStore, snapshotStore snapshotStore) *Repository
```

Here is an example of a person being saved and fetched from the repository.

```go
person := person.CreatePerson("Alice")
person.GrowOlder()
repo.Save(person)
twin := Person{}
repo.Get(person.Id, &twin)
```

### Event Store

The only thing an event store handles are events and it must implement the following interface.

```go
// saves events to an underlaying data store.
Save(events []eventsourcing.Event) error

// fetches events based on identifier and type but also after a specific version. The version is used to load event that happened after a snapshot was taken.
Get(id string, aggregateType string, afterVersion eventsourcing.Version) ([]eventsourcing.Event, error)
```

Apart the manadatory `Get` and `Save`functions an event store could also implement the `GlobalGet` function for fetching events based on the order they were saved. This function makes it possible to build separate representations often called projections 

```go
GlobalGet(start uint64, count int) []eventsourcing.Event
```

Currently there are three implementations.

* SQL
* Bolt
* RAM Memory

### Snapshot Store

A snapshot store handles snapshots. The properties of an aggregate have to be exported for them to be saved in the snapshot.

```go
 // get snapshot by identifier
Get(id string, a interface{}) error

// saves snapshot
Save(id string, a interface{}) error
```

## Serializer

The event and snapshot stores depends on a serializer to transform events and aggregates to the `[]byte` data type.

```go
SerializeSnapshot(interface{}) ([]byte, error)
DeserializeSnapshot(data []byte, a interface{}) error
SerializeEvent(event eventsourcing.Event) ([]byte, error)
DeserializeEvent(v []byte) (event eventsourcing.Event, err error)
```

### JSON

The JSON serializer has the following extra function.

```go
Register(aggregate aggregate, events ...interface{}) error
```

It needs to register the aggregate together with the events that belongs to it. It has to do this to maintain correct type info when it unmarshal an event.

```go
j := json.New()
err := j.Register(&Person{}, &Born{}, &AgedOneYear{})
```

### Unsafe

The unsafe serializer stores the underlying memory representation of a struct directly. This makes it as its name implies, unsafe to use if you are unsure what you are doing. [Here](https://youtu.be/4xB46Xl9O9Q?t=610) is the video that explains the reason for this serializer.

### Event Stream

The repository expose the `EventStream(events ...interface{}) observer.Stream` function that makes it possible to subscribe on saved events.
The returned stream will collect all events that has occurred after the call to the function and its possible to iterate over them via the functions from the [go-observer](https://github.com/imkira/go-observer) pkg (that is the pkg we use to accomplish this).  

If no events are included in the input `repo.EventStream()` all events that are saved will be present in the stream.
If events are included `repo.EventStream(&FrequentFlierAccountCreated{}, &StatusMatched{})` only events with that type will be present in the stream.
There is no restrictions that the event types need to come from the same aggregate, you can mix and match as you please.

The stream is realtime and events that are saved before the call to the EventStream function will not be present on the stream. If the application 
depends on this functionality make sure to call the function before any events are saved. 

The event stream enables the application to make use of the reactive patterns and to make it more decoupled. Check out the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) 
for more detailed information. 


Example on how to setup the event stream and consume the event `FrequentFlierAccountCreated`

```go
// Setup a memory based repository
repo := eventsourcing.NewRepository(memory.Create(unsafe.New()), nil)
stream := repo.EventStream()
	
// Read the event stream async 
go func() { 
    for {
        // wait for an event to be accessible on the stream
        event := stream.WaitNext().(eventsourcing.Event)
        // use similar switch as in the Transition function from the aggregate
        switch e := event.Data.(type) {
        case *FrequentFlierAccountCreated:
            // e now have type info
            fmt.Println(e)
        }
    }
}()
```

## Custom made components

Parts of this package may not fulfill your application need, either it can be that the event or snapshot stores uses the wrong database for storage.
Or that some other serializer is preferred other than the per existing one with JSON support. As the title implies its possible to create them by your own.  

#### Event Store

A custom made event store has to implements the following functions to fulfill the interface in the repository.  

```go
type eventStore interface {
    Save(events []Event) error
    Get(id string, aggregateType string, afterVersion Version) ([]Event, error)
}
```

#### Snapshot Store

If the snapshot store is the thing you need to change here is the interface you need to uphold.

```go
type snapshotStore interface {
    Get(id string, a interface{}) error
    Save(id string, a interface{}) error
}
```

#### Serializer

To make a custom made serializer the following interface is used in the event stores built in this package.

```go
type EventSerializer interface {
    SerializeEvent(event eventsourcing.Event) ([]byte, error)
    DeserializeEvent(v []byte) (event eventsourcing.Event, err error)
}
```

The serializer interface in the snapshot store.

```go
type snapshotSerializer interface {
    SerializeSnapshot(interface{}) ([]byte, error)
    DeserializeSnapshot(data []byte, a interface{}) error
}
```
